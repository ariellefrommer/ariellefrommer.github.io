# About Me

Hello! My name is Arielle and I'm an aspiring astronomer and science writer. My research interests lie at the intersection of exoplanets, astrochemistry, and machine learning, and I am also passionate about science communication and outreach. Besides research, I have enjoyed giving educational tours about art and astronomy at the Harvard Art Museums and covering astronomy news for Sky & Telescope.

I am a recent graduate of Harvard University, where I received a Bachelor of Arts in a joint concentration in Astrophysics and Physics, cum laude in field. Currently, I am a guest researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands, funded by Harvard's Alex G. Booth Fellowship. My project focuses on the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b, under the supervision of Professor Ignas Snellen. I will be applying to PhD programs this cycle!

In my free time, I like reading, hiking, crocheting, biking, traveling, and trying new cafes!
